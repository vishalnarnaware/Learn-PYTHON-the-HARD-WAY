# Study Drills
# 1. Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.
# Strongly recommended to do

# 2. Remember in Exercise 0 when you started Python? Start Python this way again and, using
# the above characters and what you know, use Python as a calculator.
# All on you!

# 3. Find something you need to calculate and write a new .py file that does it.
# print("My career: ", 100 - 1 / 0.001 + 6 * 2 % 13 + 11.1 * 10)

# 4. Notice the math seems “wrong”? There are no fractions, only whole numbers.
# Find out why by researching what a “floating point” number is.
# Actually I got floating numbers... So looks like some advantage of Python 3 :P

# Rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbers so it’s more accurate.
# (hint: 20.0 is floating point).
# Instead you could try to convert this to integer. Hint:
# print(int(3/5))
