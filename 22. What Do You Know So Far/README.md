# What You Are Learning  

It’s important when you are doing a boring, mindless memorization exercise like this to know why.  

It helps you focus on a goal and know the purpose of all your efforts.  


In this exercise, you are learning the names of symbols so that you can read source code more  

easily. It’s similar to learning the alphabet and basic words of English, except this Python alphabet  

has extra symbols you might not know.  


Just take it slow and do not hurt your brain. Hopefully by now these symbols are natural for you,   

so this isn’t a big effort. It’s best to take 15 minutes at a time with your list and then take a break.   

Giving your brain a rest will help you learn faster with less frustration.
