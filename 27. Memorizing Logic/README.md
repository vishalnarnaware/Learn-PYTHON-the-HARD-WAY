**Can’t I just learn the concepts behind boolean algebra and not memorize this?**

Sure, you can do that, but then you’ll have to constantly go through the rules to boolean algebra<br>
while you code. If you memorize these first, it not only builds your memorization skills but also<br>
makes these operations natural. After that, the concept of boolean algebra is easy. But do whatever works for you.
