**Can’t I just learn the concepts behind boolean algebra and not memorize this?**

Sure, you can do that, but then you’ll have to constantly go through the rules to boolean algebra

while you code. If you memorize these fi rst, it not only builds your memorization skills but also

makes these operations natural. After that, the concept of boolean algebra is easy. But do whatever works for you.
