# Study Drills

1. Take each function that is called, and go through the steps outlined  
 above to translate them to what Python does. For example, ' '.join(things)  
 is join(' ', things).  

2. Translate these two ways to view the function calls. For example,  
 ' '.join(things) reads as, “Join things with ‘ ‘ between them.”  
 Meanwhile, join(' ', things) means, “Call join with ‘ ‘ and things.”  
 Understand how they are really the same thing.  

3. Go read about “object- oriented programming” online. Confused?  
 I was too. Do not worry. You will learn enough to be dangerous,  
 and you can slowly learn more later.  

4. Read up on what a “class” is in Python. Do not read about how other  
 languages use the word “class.” That will only mess you up.  

5. What’s the relationship between dir(something) and the “class” of
 something?  

6. If you do not have any idea what I’m talking about, do not worry.  
 Programmers like to feel smart, so they invented object- oriented  
 programming, named it OOP, and then used it way too much. If you think  
 that’s hard, you should try to use “functional programming.”
