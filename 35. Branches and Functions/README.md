# Study Drills
 1. Draw a map of the game and how you flow through it.  

 2. Fix all your mistakes, including spelling mistakes.  

 3. Write comments for the functions you do not understand. Remember doc comments?  

 4. Add more to the game. What can you do to both simplify and expand it?  

 5. The gold_room has a weird way of getting you to type a number. What are all  
  the bugs in this way of doing it? Can you make it better than just checking   
  if “1” or “0” are in the number? Look at how int() works for clues.
