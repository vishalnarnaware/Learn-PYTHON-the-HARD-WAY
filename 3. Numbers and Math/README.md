<h1> Study Drills</h1>
<ol>
<li><b> Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does. </b><br>
 Strongly recommended to do<br>
<br>
<li><b> Remember in Exercise 0 when you started Python? Start Python this way again and, using<br>
 the above characters and what you know, use Python as a calculator.</b><br>
 All on you!<br>
<br>
<li><b> Find something you need to calculate and write a new .py file that does it.</b><br>
 print("My career: ", 100 - 1 / 0.001 + 6 * 2 % 13 + 11.1 * 10)<br>
<br>
<li><b> Notice the math seems “wrong”? There are no fractions, only whole numbers.
 Find out why by researching what a “floating point” number is.</b><br>
 Actually I got floating numbers... So looks like some advantage of Python 3 :P<br>
<br>
<li><b> Rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbers so it’s more accurate.
 (hint: 20.0 is floating point).</b><br>
 Instead you could try to convert this to integer. Hint:<br>
 print(int(3/5))
