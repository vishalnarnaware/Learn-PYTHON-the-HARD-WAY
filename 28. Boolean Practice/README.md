# Study Drills
 1. There are a lot of operators in Python similar to != and ==.   
 Try to find out as many “equality operators” as you can.  
 They should be like < or <=.
 2. Write out the names of each of these equality operators.  
 For example, I call != “not equal.”
 3. Play with the Python by typing out new boolean operators, and before you  
 hit Enter, try to shout out what it is. Do not think about it—just name the  
 first thing that comes to mind. Write it down, then hit Enter, and keep track  
 of how many you get right and wrong.
 4. Throw away the piece of paper from `3` so you do not accidentally try   
 to use it later.
