# Study Drills
There is only one Study Drill for this exercise because it is a big exercise.  
Go and read http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008 and start trying to use   
it in your code. You’ll notice that some of it is different from what you’ve  
been learning in this book, but now you should be able to understand their   
recommendations and use them in your own code. The rest of the code in this   
book may or may not follow these guidelines, depending on if it makes the code  
more confusing.
