# Study Drills

1. **Take a look at how you used range. Look up the range function to<br> understand it.**
`range()` function takes 3 argument (1 must - Stopping value), first is <br>
**Start** - default to 0, second **Stop** and third **jump_value** - default 1.
<br>
2. **Could you have avoided that for- loop entirely on line 22 and just <br> assigned range(0,6) directly to elements?**
 We could have used list comprehension.
 <br>
3. **Find the Python documentation on lists and read about them. What<br> other operations can you do to lists besides append?**
 replace, extend, index, insert, pop, etc.
