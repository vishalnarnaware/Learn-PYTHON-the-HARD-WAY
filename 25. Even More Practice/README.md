# Study Drills
 1. Take the remaining lines of the WYSS output and figure out what they are  
 doing. Make sure you understand how you are running your functions in the ex25 module.  

 2. Try doing this: help(ex25) and also help(ex25.break_words).   
 Notice how you get help for your module and how the help is those odd """  
 strings you put after each function in ex25? Those special strings are  
 called documentation comments and we’ll be seeing more of them.  

 3. Typing ex25. is annoying. A shortcut is to do your import like this:   
 from ex25 import \*, which is like saying, “Import everything from ex25.”  
 Programmers like saying things backward. Start a new session and see how all  
 your functions are right there.  

 4. Try breaking your fi le and see what it looks like in Python when you use  
 it. You will have to quit Python with CTRL- D (CTRL- Z on Windows) to be able  
 to reload it.
