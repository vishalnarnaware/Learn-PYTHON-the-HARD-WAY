- **Do I have to import ex25.py or can I just remove the references to it?**  
You can do either. This file has the functions from ex25 though, so first go  
with removing references to it.  

- **Can we run the code while weâ€™re fixing it?**  
You most certainly may. The computer is there to help, so use it as much as possible
