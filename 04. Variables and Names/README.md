# Study Drills
1. I used 4.0 for space_in_a_car, but is that necessary? What happens if it’s  
 just 4?  

2. Remember that 4.0 is a “fl oating point” number. Find out what that means.  

3. Write comments above each of the variable assignments.  

4. Make sure you know what = is called (equals) and that it’s making names for things.  

5. Remember that _ is an underscore character.  

6. Try running Python as a calculator like you did before and use variable  
 names to do your calculations. Popular variable names are also i, x, and j.
