# Study Drills
 1. In Terminal, where you normally run python to run your scripts,   
 type pydoc raw_input. Read what it says.   
 If you’re on Windows try python - m pydoc raw_input instead.

 2. Get out of pydoc by typing q to quit.

 3. Look online for what the pydoc command does.

 4. Use pydoc to also read about open, file, os, and sys.   
  It’s alright if you do not understand those;   
  just read through and take notes about interesting things.
