# Study Drills
# 1. Make your script print another line.
print("This is another line :)")

# 2. Make your script print only one of the lines.
print("Comment all the lines except one...\n",
      "To make script print only one of the lines.")

# 3. Put a “#” (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do?
# Try to find out what this character does.
