# Study Drills

1. **Read about ordinal and cardinal numbers online.**

2. **With what you know of the difference between these types of numbers,
can you explain why the year 2010 in “January 1, 2010,” really is 2010 and
not 2009? (Hint: you can’t pick years at random.)**

3. **Write some more lists and work out similar indexes until you can
translate them.**

4. **Use Python to check your answers to this as well**
