# Study Drills
 1. Convert this while- loop to a function that you can call, and replace 6   
 in the test (i < 6) with a variable.  

 2. Now use this function to rewrite the script to try different numbers.  

 3. Add another variable to the function arguments that you can pass in that   
 lets you change the + 1 on line 8, so you can change how much it increments by.  

 4. Rewrite the script again to use this function to see what effect that has.  

 5. Now, write it to use for- loops and range instead. Do you need the   
 incrementor in the middle anymore? What happens if you do not get rid of it?  


**If at any time that you are doing this it goes crazy (it probably will), just hold down CTRL and hit
c (CTRL- c) and the program will abort.**
