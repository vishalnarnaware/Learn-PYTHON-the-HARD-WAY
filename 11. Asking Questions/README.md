# Study Drills
 1. Go online and find out what Python’s raw_input does.

 2. Can you find other ways to use it? Try some of the samples you find.

 3. Write another “form” like this to ask some other questions.

 4. Related to escape sequences, try to find out why the last line has  
  '6\'2"' with that \' sequence. See how the single- quote needs to be   
  escaped because otherwise it would end the string?
