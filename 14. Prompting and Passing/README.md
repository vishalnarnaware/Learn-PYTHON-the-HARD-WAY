# Study Drills
 1. Find out what Zork and Adventure were. Try to find a copy and play it.

 2. Change the prompt variable to something else entirely.

 3. Add another argument and use it in your script.

 4. Make sure you understand how I combined a """ style multiline string with  
  the % format activator as the last print.
