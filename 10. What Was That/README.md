# Study Drills
 1. Memorize all the escape sequences by putting them on flash cards.
 2. Use ''' (triple- single- quote) instead.  
  Can you see why you might use that instead of """?  

 3. Combine escape sequences and format strings to create a more complex format.

 4. Remember the %r format? Combine %r with double- quote and single- quote  
  escapes and print them out. Compare %r with %s. Notice how %r prints it the  
  way you’d write it in your file, but %s prints it the way you’d like to see it?
