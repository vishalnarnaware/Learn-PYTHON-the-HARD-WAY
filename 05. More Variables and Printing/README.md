# Study Drills
 1. Change all the variables so there isn’t the my_ in front. Make sure you  
  change the name everywhere, not just where you used = to set them.  

 2. Try more format characters. %r is a very useful one. It’s like saying  
  “print this no matter what.”  

 3. Search online for all the Python format characters.  

 4. Try to write some variables that convert the inches and pounds to  
  centimeters and kilos. Do not just type in the measurements.   
  Work out the math in Python.
