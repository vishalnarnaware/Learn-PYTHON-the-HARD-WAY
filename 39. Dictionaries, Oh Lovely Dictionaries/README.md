1. Do this same kind of mapping with cities and states/regions in your  
 country or in some other country.  

2. Go find the Python documentation for dictionaries (a.k.a. dicts, dict),  
 and try to do even more things to them.  

3. Find out what you canâ€™t do with dictionaries. A big limitation is that  
 they do not have order, so try playing with that.
