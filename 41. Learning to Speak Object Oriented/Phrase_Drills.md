# Phrase Drills
Next I have a list of Python code snippets on the left and the English   
sentences for them:  
    class X(Y) “Make a class named X that is- a Y.”  
    class X(object): def \__init__(self, J)   
        “class X has- a \__init__ that takes self and J parameters.”  
    class X(object): def M(self, J)   
        “class X has- a function named M that takes self and J parameters.”  
    foo = X()  
        “Set foo to an instance of class X.”  
    foo.M(J)   
        “From foo get the M function, and call it with parameters self, J.”  
    foo.K = Q   
        “From foo get the K attribute, and set it to Q.”  
In each of these where you see X, Y, M, J, K, Q, and foo, you can treat  
those like blank spots. For example, I can also write these sentences as follows:  
1. “Make a class named ??? that is- a Y.”
2. “class ??? has- a __init__ that takes self and ??? parameters.”
3. “class ??? has- a function named ??? that takes self and ??? parameters.”
4. “Set foo to an instance of class ???.”
5. “From foo get the ??? function, and call it with self=??? and parameters ???.”
6. “From foo get the ??? attribute and set it to ???.”
