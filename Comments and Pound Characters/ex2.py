# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print("I could have code like this.")  # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print("This won't run.")

print("This will run.")

# Study Drills
# 1. Find out if you were right about what the # character does and make sure
# you know what itâ€™s called (octothorpe or pound character).
# Yep I was right about # character (octothorpe) however I did used to call it
# "Hash".

# 2. Take your ex2.py file and review each line going backward. Start at the
# last line, and check each word in reverse against what you should have typed.
# Read it out loud.

# 3. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
# None.

# 4. Read what you typed previously out loud, including saying each character
# by its name. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
# No mistakes but called 'Octothorpe' 'Hash' again -_-
