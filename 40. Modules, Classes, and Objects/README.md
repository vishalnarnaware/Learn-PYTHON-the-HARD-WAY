# Study Drills
1. Write some more songs using this, and make sure you understand that  
 you’re passing a list of strings as the lyrics.  

2. Put the lyrics in a separate variable, then pass that variable to the  
class to use instead.  

3. See if you can hack on this and make it do more things. Don’t worry if  
 you have no idea how, just give it a try, see what happens. Break it,  
 trash it, thrash it, you can’t hurt it.  

4. Search online for “object- oriented programming” and try to overflow   
your brain with what you read. Don’t worry if it makes absolutely no sense  
to you. Half of that stuff makes no sense to me either.
