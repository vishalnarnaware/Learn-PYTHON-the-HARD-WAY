# Study Drills
1. Research why Python added this strange object class and what that means.
2. Is it possible to use a class like it’s an object?
3. Fill out the animals, fish, and people in this exercise with functions  
that make them do things. See what happens when functions are in a “base  
class” like Animal versus Dog.
4. Find other people’s code and work out all the is-a and has-a relationships.
5. Make some new relationships that are lists and dicts so you can also have  
“has- many” relationships.  
6. Do you think there’s a such thing as an “is- many” relationship?  
Read about “multiple inheritance,” then avoid it if you can.
