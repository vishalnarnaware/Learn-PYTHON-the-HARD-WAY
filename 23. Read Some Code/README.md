# Here’s what you do:  
 1. Go to bitbucket.org, github.com, or gitorious.org with your favorite web  
 browser and search for “python.”  

 2. Avoid any project that mentions “Python 3.” That’ll only confuse you.  
 **See only Python 3 :P**   

 3. Pick a random project and click on it.  

 4. Click on the Source tab and browse through the list of files and   
 directories until you find a .py file (but not setup.py—that’s useless).  

 5. Start at the top and read through it, taking notes on what you think it does.

 6. If any symbols or strange words seem to interest you, write them down to   research later
